The WBC is a hydraulic modeling and decision support tool that can simulate multiple hydraulic, hydrological, and physical scenarios to provide users with results that can be used to aid in decision making for improving or developing land for productive purposes in a development context. 

> This tool was developed for an Ethiopian Context by CRS, Garde Engineering, and LimnoTech Engineering with funds from USAID and Food For Peace under the Development Food Security Activities Program.

The WBC is a computer program that can be installed on Windows-based machines and uses the Hydraulic Simulation Program - Fortan (HSPF) modeling framework to calculate hydraulic and soil responses due to land changes within a micro-watershed context, e.g. at the farm plot scale.
