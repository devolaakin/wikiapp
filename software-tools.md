# Google Earth
Google Earth is a free mapping software that has high resolution imagery and several tools that can be helpful when using the WBC. The main tool that will help WBC users is the **Ruler**.

# ESRI ArcGIS/ArcMap
ESRI ArcGIS Pro and ArcMap are mapping tools that can be used to help layout and measure plots for analysis within the WBC. However, this software it not free, but you may have access through your organization. This software also requires training to use and is not as easy to immediately use as Google Earth and is only recommended to be used with the WBC if you have previous experience with ESRI products.

# QGIS
QGIS is a powerful, open-source (**free**), geographical information systems software package that could be used to help you when developing WBC projects. However, QGIS is a complex tool that generally requires previous training and strong computer skills/knowledge. QGIS has very good training documentation and tutorials, but because QGIS was not used during the WBC development, additional instructions on how it can be used to aid with WBC use are not included on this website.
