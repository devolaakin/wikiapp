# Plots
The WBC is designed to anlayze plot-scale areas of land. This typically ranges from 0.25 hectares (ha) to 5 ha. This is because there are other tools that have been developed that are more suited for entire watershed analysis. However, the WBC can be used to look for patterns on which land cover options within different scenarios can be the most effective at meeting your WBC modeling goal. 

## Smallholder Farmers v. Public Land
In Ethiopia, typically the most upgradient areas of land on a hillside are communal or public land and is not normally farmed. See aerial image below. The public land is the hillside that then runs down into the more flat area which is private land.

Natural resource management practices are normally implemented on public land during the GoE's public works season. **Because of this, when you use the WBC, you should determine if the analysis will be for public or private land because you may have a different goal for each**. Public land analysis could be looking at ways to reduce erosion and water runoff, which is different than private land, which could be focused on improving climate change resiliency. 


In the above picture, if you wanted to analyze both public and private land, then you would want to split it up into several plots as shown below.

## General Guidelines for Plot Selection
There are no exact rules for plot selection for using the WBC, but there are a few guidelines that will help you as you use the WBC. 
1. **Major changes in slope/grade**: In the WBC, plots are simplified to have the same slope/grade throughout. Because of this, it is good to make separate plots for areas where the grade changes dramatically. Below is a picture of the above hillside in profile view and you can see 3 distinct slope/grade changes.

2. **Different land owners**: If you are working with smallholder farmers, it is a good idea to analyze the land of each independently. 
3. **Avoid weird/non-rectangular shaped plots**: The WBC lays out plots in rectangles. Obviously, not every plot (in fact most) are not perfectly rectangular and that is okay, but you should try to avoid trying to analyze plots that are uncommon shapes.

4. **Avoid very large plots**: The WBC is meant for anlaysis of small plots. If you want to analyze entire watersheds, than the WBC is not the tool for this. 
5. **Large man-made or natural barriers**: You should make separate plots for land on different sides of a road, river, or stream. The WBC is not developed to model these large barriers between plots.
