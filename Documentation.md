# WBC Term Glossary

|Term|Definition|
|:----|:----------|
Accuracy|	Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true or accepted value.|
Active GW| storage (mm/yr)	Difference between final and initial water storage within the active/shallow groundwater layer in a plot for a given scenario, expressed as an annualized rate of change. This value will tend to be large relative to other storages (i.e., interception, surface, soil, and interflow).|
Bare Soil|	Land that has no vegetation or NRM intervention.| 
Basin Storage (mm/yr)|	Difference between final and initial standing water storage above the soil surface across all infiltration basin features (e.g., pits, Fanya Juu) in a plot for a specific scenario, expressed as an annualized rate of change.|
Bench+Chat|	A bench terrace with chat planted on it.| 
Bench+Maize/Sorghum|	A bench terrace with maize/sorghum planted on it.| 
Bench+Small Grain|A bench terrace with small grain, such as teff, planted on it.  
Bund (grass)|	A bund, which is a small mound built along the contour of a hillside, that has grass planted in the mounded soil. 
Bund (rock)|	A bund, which is a small mound built along the contour of a hillside, that has rocks stacked on the mounded soil to stabilize the soil. 
Cell|	A transect is composed of cells. A cell is represented by one type of land cover and is the same width as the transect but can have a its own length. All the lengths of the cells in a single transect should sum to the total length of the transect, which is equal to the downslope length. 
Change in Water Storage (mm/yr)|	Difference between final and initial total storage of water within a plot for a specific scenario, expressed as an annualized rate of change. This result represents the sum of water storage within the following compartments: canopy interception, upper/lower unsaturated soil layers, and the shallow aquifer layer.
Chat/Khat|	Catha edulis, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia.
Cross Plot Width|	The horizontal width (perpendicular to the slope of the plot), in meters, of the plot being modeled. 
Downslope Length|	The vertical length (or top to bottom length), in meters, of the plot being modeled. 
Dry Bulk Density|	Also known as Bulk Density, is a measurement of a dry soil’s mass divided by the total volume it occupies. This value can change for different soil types and is dependent on how much the soil has been compacted. 
Evapotranspiration (mm/yr)|	Annual average rate of water exiting the plot via all evapotranspiration (ET) pathways. This value represents the sum of ET from interception, the unsaturated (upper/lower) soil zones, and the upper aquifer layer.
Fanya Juu Height|	The vertical depth of the level Fanya Juu channel given in meters. 
Grass Strip|	A grass strip is a ribbon-like band of grass laid out on cultivated land along the contour. Usually, grass strips are about 1 m wide and spaced at 1 m vertical intervals. They are mainly used to replace physical structures on soil with good infiltration (sandy, silty) on gentle slopes.
Groundwater Outflow (mm/yr)|	Annual average rate of water that exits the lower boundary of the plot as outflow from the active aquifer layer (for a specific scenario).
Hillside|	The second level of the WBC, right below project, a hillside is a geographical area with similar soil and weather characteristics. A hillside does not have to have a steep slope or grade. 
Hillslope (0-100%)|	Represents land cover conditions for a generic hillslope area/cell, with the selected ground cover (0-100%, in 10% increments) representing the degree to which vegetation covers the area.
HSPF|	“Hydrologic Simulation Program – Fortran” (HSPF) is the underlying hydrological and water quality model framework that the WBC has been based on.
Infiltration Rate|	The infiltration rate is a measure of how fast water enters the soil, typically expressed in millimeters per hour.
Interception ET (mm/yr)|	Annual average rate of water exiting the plot as evapotranspiration from canopy interception storage (under a specific scenario).
Interception Storage (mm/yr)|	Difference between final and initial water storage intercepted by vegetation canopy that extends above the ground surface (e.g., crops, trees, etc.), for a plot under a specific scenario (expressed as an annualized rate of change). 
Interflow (mm/yr)|	Annual average rate of water exiting the lower boundary of the plot via interflow, for a plot under a specific scenario. “Interflow” is shallow subsurface flow through the unsaturated soil zone, which differentiates it from groundwater outflow.
Interflow Storage (mm/yr)|	Difference between final and initial water storage in the interflow compartment for a plot under a specific scenario, expressed as an annualized rate of change. Like surface storage, interflow storage is transient and so these values are typically small.
Land Cover|	In the WBC, land cover is the term for anything that physically represents something on the surface of a plot. This could be ground cover, crops, vegetation, NRM structures/interventions, etc. All land cover options are in the land cover palette in the WBC scenario builder. One type of land cover is applied to each cell. 
Level Fanya Juu|	A level Fanya Juu (‘throw uphill’ in Swahili language) is an embankment along the contour, made of soil and/or stones, with a basin at its lower side. The Fanya Juu reduces or stops the velocity of overland flow and consequently soil erosion. The water retention basin is at the lower side of the wall. Tied ridges about every 10 meters are also used here to prevent runoff from flowing sideways.
Lower Soil Zone Storage (mm/yr)|	Difference between final and initial water storage in the lower unsaturated soil layer for a given plot under a specific scenario, expressed as an annualized rate of change.
Maize/Sorghum|	In the WBC, Maize (Zea mays) and Sorghum are both cereal crops and treated equally more modeling purposes. 
Microbasin (mature)|	A conservation practice where a small circle or semi-circle is excavated and planted with a tree. This option represents a microbasin where the tree has reached maturity, or full canopy cover. 
Microbasin (young)|	A conservation practice where a small circle or semi-circle is excavated and planted with a tree. This option represents a microbasin where the tree was recently planted, with lower canopy cover than a mature tree.
Organic Matter Content|	Organic Matter Content, also known as soil organic matter (SOM), is the organic component of soil, consisting of three primary parts including small (fresh) plant residues and small living soil organisms, decomposing (active) organic matter, and stable organic matter (humus). Soil organic matter serves as a reservoir of nutrients for crops, provides soil aggregation, increases nutrient exchange, retains moisture, reduces compaction, reduces surface crusting, and increases water infiltration into soil
Planting Pit|	A small trench, typically 2-3 m long and less than 0.5 m deep that has a tree planted in the center of it. 
Planting Pit Height|	Vertical depth from the surface to the bottom of the planting pit in meters. 
Plot|	A small parcel of land, typically 0.25 ha to XXXX [LT Fill in max size] ha that is the primary area being analyzed in the WBC. Different scenarios are developed for each plot. 
Precipitation (mm/yr)|	The amount of rainfall for a region in a given year. 
Precision|	Precision refers to how close measurements of the same item are to each other
Project|	The highest level of the WBC hierarchy. Everything within a project has the same coordinates and general location. 
Recharge to Active Aquifer (mm/yr)|	Annual average rate of water that enters the active (upper) aquifer layer that underlies the unsaturated soil zone. 
Recharge to Deep Aquifer (mm/yr)|	Annual average rate of water that enters the deep (lower) aquifer layer that underlies the unsaturated soil zone. Water routed to the deep aquifer is considered to be “lost” from the plot.
Residue|	Residue refers to the crop material that is left in a particular area following harvesting of the crop. The benefits of good crop residue management practices are improved soil quality and reduced soil erosion and runoff.
Rock/Soil Bund Height|	The vertical height, in meters, from the ground to the top of the bund. 
Runoff (mm/yr)|	Annual average rate of water that leaves the lower boundary of a plot as surface runoff, under a particular scenario.
Scenario|	A use case that is composed of an arrangement of transects with a specific set of land cover cells. Different scenarios are developed for the same plot to compare which land cover options meet the goal of the WBC user. 
Sediment (MT/ha/yr)|	The total yield of sediment (in metric tons per hectare per year) exiting the lower boundary of a plot under a particular scenario. This result represents cumulative sediment yield across all transects represented in the scenario.
Simulation Year(s)|	Calendar year(s) that a WBC simulation is run for, corresponding to approximate (observed or synthetic) weather conditions at the location of the project.
Slope|	The grade (also called slope, incline, gradient, mainfall, pitch or rise) of a physical feature, landform or constructed line refers to the tangent of the angle of that surface to the horizontal. It is a special case of the slope, where zero indicates horizontality. A larger number indicates higher or steeper degree of "tilt". Often slope is calculated as a ratio of "rise" to "run", or as a fraction ("rise over run") in which run is the horizontal distance (not the distance along the slope) and rise is the vertical distance.
Small Grain|Small grains refer to cereal crops such as wheat, teff, or barley that produce small seeds and are typically grown in narrowly spaced rows or broadcast planted at relatively high seeding densities.	
Soil Depth|	The soil depth input represents the depth of the soil profile (from the surface to the parent material, bedrock, or the layer of obstacles for roots) that is readily available for storing infiltrated water.
Soil ET (mm/yr)|	Annual average rate of total evaporation from the upper/lower unsaturated soil layers for a plot under a specific scenario.
Soil Texture|	The soil texture as determined by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service classification. There are 12 classifications, sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silt, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, and clay.
Surface Storage (mm/yr)|	Difference between final and initial water storage at the soil surface for a given plot under a specific scenario, expressed as an annualized rate of change. (Surface storage is very transient, so this value tends to be small.)
Terrace+young trees|	A bench terrace planted with young trees. 
Total Recharge (mm/yr)|	Annual average rate of water entering shallow and deep aquifer regions below the unsaturated lower soil zone, for a given plot under a specific scenario.
Transect|	Vertical division of a plot. Plots are divided into strips of land, known as transects, that run from the top of the plot to the bottom of a plot. Multiple transects are combined to create the entire plot. A transect length is the same length as the Plot Downslope Length and all the transect widths added together should be the same as the Cross Plot Width. 
Trees (mature)|	 A conservation practice where trees are planted along a hillslope to reduce soil erosion and runoff by stabilizing the soil, protecting from raindrop impact, and increasing evapotranspiration. This option represents a condition where the trees were recently planted (i.e., less than 5 years prior), with lower canopy cover than mature trees.
Trees (young)| A conservation practice where trees are planted along a hillslope to reduce soil erosion and runoff by stabilizing the soil, protecting from raindrop impact, and increasing evapotranspiration. This option represents a condition where the trees were recently planted, with lower canopy cover than mature trees.
Upper Soil Zone Storage (mm/yr)|	Difference between final and initial water storage in the upper unsaturated soil layer for a given plot under a specific scenario, expressed as an annualized rate of change. (This layer typically has lower water capacity and storage relative to the lower unsaturated soil layer.)
USDA|	United States Department of Agriculture
Vegetative Bund Height|	The vertical height, in meters, from the ground to the top of the bund.
