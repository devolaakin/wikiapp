# Computer Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10 (64-bit version currently required)
> Note: Currently, WBC is strictly being compiled as a 64-bit program that must run under 64-bit Windows. While we could compile a 32-bit version, that would likely result in the application crashing if the user was attempting to load imagery files for the map.

- CPU: no specific requirement (if CPU is sufficient to run Win 10, it should be sufficient to run WBC, although clock speed will dictate time required to run simulations)
- Memory (RAM): 
	- 4 GB for base program only without supporting imagery/raster data 
	- 8+ GB for base program and loading/viewing the detailed imagery.
- Hard disk space:
	- 0.25 GB for base program installation without supporting imagery/raster data
	- 10 GB for base program and all supporting imagery (for current version [V2])
- Supporting software (optional):
		- Microsoft Excel (2010 or newer) â€“ required to view exported WBC results
> You may need admin rights on your PC to install. Please discuss this with your IT department or computer administrator.
