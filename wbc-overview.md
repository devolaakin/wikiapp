# Developing a Goal
The purpose of using the WBC is to develop land use scenarios that watershed managers, decision makers, engineers, ecologists, farmers, and others can compare to determine what is the arrangement of land uses that meets a particular goal. That goal could be, greatest increase in soil moisture content, reduction in soil erosion, least cost option for public work interventions, land uses that increase climate change resilience, etc. There are many possible goals, that you, as the WBC user and scenario builder may have and it may be unique to the project and/or area you are working in. 

> Setting a goal for using the WBC is important for understanding the results and choosing the right scenario for your project.

The reason setting a goal is so important is that there are hundreds of different ways public or private land could be developed or restored. Because of this, it is knowing **why** you are using the WBC and **what** you want to accomplish with it are absolutely critical. 

Some example goals are as follows:
- I want to know if adding rock bunds between my crop rows reduces soil erosion more than planting grass strips. 
- I want to know if building terraces will increase groundwater recharge on public lands more than area enclosures. 
- I want to know if planting more chat instead of maize/sorghum will have any negative impact on my soil moisture and soil erosion. 
- I want to know if using soil bunds and more ground cover has a similar effect to building terraces because soil bunds are cheaper. 

# WBC Hierarchy
A WBC Project has several layers of inputs before an analysis can be performed. Setting up your WBC analysis begins with creating a **Project** and inside that project you are allowed to have multiple sublevels, which consist of **hillsides, plots, and scenarios**. See the graphic below for a general overview of the WBC and the inputs required for each level.

# WBC Key Terms
There are several key terms to be aware of as you use the WBC that will help you use it successfully. A complete list of WBC terms can be found [here](/About). 
- **Hillside**: the hillside is the first layer within a WBC project. A hillside is meant to be a geographical area with similar soil and weather conditions. Because land ownership is typically only a few hectares or less, a hillside typically has many plots. It is assumed these plots share the same general soil and weather conditions throughout the hillside. A WBC project can have many hillsides so if the soil and weather conditions vary within a small geographical context, new hillsides can be created to accommodate this. 
- **Plot**: a plot is normally a small area of public or private land, less than 0.5 hectares to 5 hectares, and is the primary area you are using the WBC to analyze. However, if you are trying to determine if certain interventions or public works are going to be effective over an entire hillside or larger area, then it is a good idea to break the area into several smaller plots based on the area's slope changes. 
- **Scenario**: a scenario is a use case or an arrangement of land uses, interventions, and crops that you want to analyze and compare to see which arrangement meets your goal the best. These land cover options are typically arranged in a pattern, but do not have to be. 
- **Transect**: a transect is a vertical strip of land that is made of cells. The cells are different types of land cover, such as crops, interventions, etc. Several transects are arranged together horizontally and these make up a scenario, as shown below. This graphic demonstrates the relationship between plots, scenarios, transects, and land cover (cells).

- **Land** **Cover**: for the purposes of the WBC, land cover refers to any physical thing on the surface. This includes crops, soil, ground cover, planting pits, trenches, bunds, etc. 
- **Intervention**: for the purposes of the WBC, interventions are a type of land cover and typically refer to natural resource management practices that could increase soil moisture content, reduce erosion, reduce runoff, etc. The government of Ethiopia has developed a set of NRM interventions that are typically applied on public lands during Public Work season, but some are also used on private lands by farmers.
