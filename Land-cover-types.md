This section provides a description of the various types of land cover (LC) types currently represented in the CRS WBC tool. Note that any of the LC types discussed below can be assigned to a given cell represented within a user-specified WBC transect. The icons used in the WBC for each land cover type are depicted in each sub-section, in addition to a photograph or illustration of the land cover.

# Ground Cover
Ground Cover in the WBC interface, represents the open space, devoid of overstory vegetation, that may occur on managed or unmanaged public lands located upslope of an actively farmed plot area, or, potentially, with a private plot area. Ground cover may contain herbaceous understory vegetation that provides various levels of ground cover (GC). The land cover options provided in the WBC include “Bare soil” to represent bare soil conditions (i.e., no herbaceous ground cover) and other (partially vegetated) hillslope types, with herbaceous cover increasing in increments of 25%, to represent various levels of percent ground cover:
- Base Soil (<10%) – land without almost any vegetation
-	Ground Cover (0-25%) – low vegetated condition
-	Ground Cover (25-50%) – low to moderately vegetated
-	Ground Cover (50-75%) – moderate to highly vegetated
-	Ground Cover (75-100%) – highly vegetated

In Figure A, an area enclosure is used to improve land with degraded vegetation and/or soil through natural regeneration to increase ground cover by excluding grazing livestock. Hillslope areas are assumed to follow the general slope characteristic of the “parent” plot area.

# Maize/Sorghum, Small Grain, and Chat
These land cover categories refer to various Ethopian crop types planted on a hillslope without terracing. Crop types are grouped into the following 3 options: maize or sorghum; chat (or khat); or small grains such as wheat, teff, or barley (Figure B).

# Bench Terrace + Maize/Sorghum, Small Grain, or Chat
A bench terrace is a conservation structure where a slope is converted into a series of steps, with a horizontal cultivated area on the step and steep risers between two steps (Figure C). Relative to the previous land cover options, the bench terrace option has the same 3 crop type groups, but a much shallower slope.

# Tree Planting (young or mature)
Tree planting for conservation is an activity to improve the vegetative ground cover, thereby reducing runoff and soil erosion and producing wood (Figure D). Tree planting by itself is a soil and water conservation measure because the tree roots stabilise the soil and the tree protects the ground from the impact of raindrops. Two options are available based on the relative maturity of the tree canopy. Generally, the “young” option will be appropriate for trees that have been planted less than 5 years prior.

# Terrace + Tree Planting (young or mature)
A hillside terrace is a structure along the contour, where a strip of land is levelled for tree planting (Figure E). Hillside terraces are up to 1 m wide and constructed at about 2–5 m vertical intervals. Hillside terraces are only applied if there is a strong reason to justify their construction.

# Microbasin (young or mature)
A microbasin is a small structure with the shape of a half or a full circle, excavated to obtain a small basin for planting a tree (Figure F). Microbasins vary in size according to their designation to conserve water; they are small in moist agroecological zones and large in dry ones. Generally, the “young” option will be appropriate for microbasins that have had trees planted less than 5 years prior.

# Grass Strip (or Live Barrier)
A grass strip is a ribbon-like band of grass laid out on cultivated land along the contour. Usually, grass strips are about 1 m wide and spaced at 1 m vertical intervals. They are mainly used to replace physical structures on soil with good infiltration (sandy, silty) on gentle slopes.

# Planting Pit (trench)
A pit (or trench) is a short ditch dug along the contour (i.e. across the slope) to trap runoff water in dry and moist areas. The trees will be planted in a planting pit in the center of the trench. Trenches are particularly useful to help rehabilitate degraded lands.

# Fanya Juu
A level Fanya Juu is an embankment along the contour, made of soil and/or stones, with a basin at its lower side. The Fanya Juu reduces or stops the velocity of overland flow and consequently soil erosion. By contrast with the Level Bund, the soil in a Fanya Juu is moved upslope for construction. The water retention basin is thus at the lower side of the wall. Tied ridges about every 10 metres are also used to prevent runoff from flowing sideways.

# Level Bund (stone, soil, or vegetative)
A level bund is an embankment along the contour, made of soil and/or stones, with a basin at its upper side. The bund reduces or stops the velocity of overland flow and consequently soil erosion. A vegetative bund has crops or other vegetation planted on the bund.
